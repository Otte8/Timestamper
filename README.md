# Overview

Timestamper is a very small Python script designed to take timestamps from the time the script was executed by the click of a button. The script was developed with streaming in mind, and the original purpose of the script was to log timestamps for creating montages from your stream.
This is only one thing Timestamper can be used for of course. Use it however you like!

[Installation](#installation) is easy, and you do **NOT** need to know anything about coding! Everything needed to change the way timestamps are logged is descriped in [Change Key](#change-key).


# Installation

**Only Windows 10 is officially supported, but Timestamper should work on MAC and Linux**
